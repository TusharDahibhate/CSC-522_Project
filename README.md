## Topic Modeling on the Enron Email dataset

As a part of this project we applied topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-
negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to segregate the emails based on their content and tried to derive important insights from the database.
